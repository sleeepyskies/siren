 * Furthermore, a VAO simplifies logic, as once set up and bound to a VBO and
 * EBO, only the VAO must be bound again before each draw call is performed.
 *
 * @note siren currently only supports one VertexBuffer per VertexArray
 * @note siren only supports indexed drawing, so an IndexBuffer must always be provided
